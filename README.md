Scenario:

RepairHub, a local repair services company with 50 technicians across the city, faces service management challenges due to distributed field operations and multiple repair locations.

Our solution:

A cloud-based Repair Management Application hosted on AWS. The architecture features a Next.js frontend on AWS Amplify, Node.js backend on Elastic Beanstalk, and CloudFront for secure content delivery. This scalable application centralizes repair tracking, enables real-time service coordination, and improves workflow efficiency across all repair locations and field teams.

About Project:

In this project, we'll intentionally introduce some errors while building the application, and then walk through the troubleshooting process using services like Amazon CloudWatch. By the end, you'll gain hands-on experience in both application development and diagnosing real-world issues, just like a cloud support engineer!
